		<p class="subtitles">Project Background</p>
		<p class="main-text">Club Hub is a high fidelity wireframe project for the course Design Process Context and System. Throughout the semester, we learned about the design process and completed multiple projects in two week long sprints. For the final project, we had to design a mobile application for a specific group of users.</p>
		<p class="subtitles">Define + Empathize</p>
		<p class="main-text">We wanted to design a mobile app to help college students better keep track of the organizations they are involved in around campus. Ultimately, it would improve the experience of organizing extracurriculars by creating a platform that can hold all of the information in one place.</p>
		<p class="subtitles">Ideate</p>
		<p class="main-text">For this stage, we sketched wireframes and drafted the overall aesthetic for the application.</p>

		<p class="subtitles">Prototyping</p>
		<p class="main-text">We created used Adobe Illustrator to design the layout of the pages and Adobe XD to create the physical prototype.</p>
		<p id ="clubHubLink" class="pic-text">Here is the final prototype</p>
		<p class="subtitles">Final Takeaways</p>
		<p class="main-text">Through this course, I learned about the design process and found it helpful to have completed a variety of projects to see how it applies in different contexts. This project gave me a basic view of how to design an application with a focus on following the design process. In the future, I would like to complete a similar, more in depth project where I can also focus on how to design the layout of the pages.</p>
