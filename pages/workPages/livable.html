		<p class="subtitles">Project Background</p>
		<p class="main-text">Livable is a high fidelity wireframe project for the course Interaction Design, in which I had to design a responsive web application. </p>
		<p class="subtitles">Empathize</p>
		<p class="main-text">The first stage of the project was to empathize and learn what it would be like to walk a mile in the users' shoes. To do this, I created four personas based on people I know to better understand the user's needs.</p>
		<p class="main-text">After, I brainstormed five potental web applications based on my findings from the personas.</p>
		<p class="pic-text">Sketch-a-Run: A site where users can draw their running route to better plan their workout.</p>
		<p class="pic-text">Smart Calendar: A calendar designed to plan someone's day and maximize productivity.</p>
		<p class="pic-text">Shop Eco: A site where users can shop for top rated environmentally friendly products.</p>
		<p class="pic-text">Study a Broad: A site that designs a trip based on the users personal interests and budget.</p>
		<p class="pic-text">MyHealth: A one-stop site where users can track all of their health needs and appointments.</p>
		<p class="subtitles">Define</p>
		<p class="main-text">The next stage was to refine my project idea and define what the web application would do.</p>
		<p class="main-text">A common theme I found among my personas was that they were stressed about all of the assignments and work they needed to do. Therefore, I decided to focus on my idea of creating a Smart Calendar.</p>
		<img class="login-pic" src="..\..\imgs\smartCalendar.png"/>
		<p class="main-text">To better refine this idea, I completed interviews with three people to gain more insight as to how they would use such an application in their lives. After the interviews, I came to the conclusion that this application would not be useful because all of my participants did not like the idea of a computer planning out their entire day for them.</p>
		<p class="main-text">One thing I noticed from all of the interviews was that my participants were stressed about all of the things they needed to do. I wanted to create an application that would reduce this stress and I approached the problem the wrong way by creating an application to manage these tasks. I then had the idea to create an application that would make one of these tasks easier and less time consuming.</p>
		<p class="main-text">One of my participants is stressed about having to find a new roommate when she moves. This gave me the idea to create an application that makes it easier for a person to connect with a compatible roommate.</p>
		<p class="main-text">Here is my final project proposal: </p>
		<p class="accent-text">For college students or people just out of college who are searching for a compatible roommate, Livable is a web application that allows users to search for their ideal roommate using advanced search features, interest groups, and compatibility ratings. Unlike other home finders, such as Airbnb or Roomster, Livable is focused on connecting people who would be compatible roommates.</p>
		<p class="subtitles">Site Map</p>
		<p class="main-text">Once I defined the project, I began the prototyping process by creating a site map and hand drawn wireframe sketches. The site map shows how the content is organized for both an annonymous and frequent user.</p>
		<img class="login-pic" src="..\..\imgs\RoommateFinderSiteMap.png"/>
		<p class="main-text">The wireframe sketchs give an idea as to where the UI components will be and a high level view of the organization of each page.</p>
		<p class="subtitles">Ideate</p>
		<p class="main-text">For this stage, I completed a Competitive Usability Evaluation where I analyzed other sites that were similar to mine. I found this stage to be very helpful since I was exposed to other features, functionalities, and UI components that I can use in my project.</p>
		<p class="main-text">I decided to look at three sites, Airbnb, Roomster, and Tinder.</p>
		<p class="pic-text">Airbnb: I like the idea of using a map to allow users to scroll around an area and having the search results displayed next to the map.</p>
		<img class="login-pic" src="..\..\imgs\Airbnb.png"/>
		<p class="pic-text">Roomster: I liked many of the UI components that the site used for the search section such as toggle buttons and drop down menus.</p>
		<img class="login-pic" src="..\..\imgs\roomster.png"/>
		<p class="pic-text">Tinder: I wanted to include a swiping feature either through a carousel or stack so the user gets a clear snapshot of every search result.</p>
		<img class="login-pic" src="..\..\imgs\tinder.png"/>
		<p class="subtitles">Wireframes</p>
		<p class="main-text">Next, I created two clickable wireframes for two primary workflows. This helped me better organize the layout of the page and decide where all the UI components would be placed. The wireframes for both workflows on both web and mobile can be found below.</p>
		<p class="main-text">The first wireframe is a workflow for an annonymous user searching for a potential roommate on the site.</p>
		<p id="WF1Web" class="pic-text">Web</p>
		<p id="WF1Mobile" class="pic-text">Mobile</p>
		<p class="main-text">The second wireframe is a workflow for a logged in user going to message a potential roommate.</p>
		<p id="WF2Web" class="pic-text">Web</p>
		<p id="WF2Mobile" class="pic-text">Mobile</p>
		<p class="subtitles">Testing</p>
		<p class="main-text">I am currently on the testing stage of this project where I will be completing usability tests with five users to better understand how they will interact with my project.</p>
		<p class="subtitles">Final Takeaways</p>
		<p class="main-text">I am still working on this project and have a few more steps left before the final application design is complete. However, this project has taught me so much about following the design process and creating an application based on the users' needs. One of my favorite parts of this project was completing a brain drawing where I presented my idea to a small group and we all sketched wireframes for various pages of the project. I found this to be very helpful since it gave me direction as to how to design my wireframes.</p>
