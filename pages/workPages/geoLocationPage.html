		<p class="subtitles">Project Background</p>
		<p class="main-text">Conscious Consumer is a high fidelity prototype for an application which allows users to look up nearby businesses that support issues they care about. This was completed for the course 5D Fundamentals where I was introduced to the basics of mobile and web experience design.</p>
		<p class="subtitles">Define + Empathize</p>
		<p class="main-text">For the first part of the project, I created a persona and mood board to help me understand who would be using this application.</p>
		<img class="login-pic" src="..\..\imgs\CCmoodBoard.png"/>
		<p class="subtitles">Prototyping</p>
		<p class="main-text">I completed the prototype of the app using Adobe XD and coded the front end for web using HTML and CSS.</p>
		<p id="ConsWeb" class="pic-text"> XD Web</p>
		<p id="ConsMobile" class="pic-text">XD Mobile</p>
		<p id="ConsTablet" class="pic-text">XD Tablet</p>
		<p id="ConsCode" class="pic-text">HTML/CSS</p>
		<p class="subtitles">Final Takeaways</p>
		<p class="main-text">This class focused on following the design process as well as creating an application that provides the user with a great experience. Through this project, I was able to get more practice following the design process as well as more practice with HTML and CSS. I also learned about the importance of designing a project based around the user and their needs. By creating the personas in the empathize stage, I was given insight as to who I was designing this application for and had a better direction as to where to take the project.</p>
