		<p class="subtitles">Project Background</p>
		<p class="main-text">The Food Comparison App is the final project for the course Database Design, in which we were to create an application that can create, read, update, and delete data from a database.</p>
		<p class="subtitles">About the App</p>
		<p class="main-text">The goal of the app is for users to be able to compare the price and nutritional value of fruits and vegetables to popular snacks. The user can make a new login with a username and password, which is stored in the database, and can choose from a variety of produce and snack to view their information. If the user finds a food that they would like to remember, they can add it to their list of favorite fruits and vegetables or their list of favorite snacks.</p>

		<p class="subtitles">The Database</p>
		<p class="main-text">We created a database through a MySQL server and imported our data from the United States Department of Agriculture. The data included information about the price, calories, and portion size of a variety of fruits, vegetables, and snacks.</p>

		<p class="subtitles">Front End</p>
		<p class="main-text">The interface was created using the Java application Java Swing.</p>

		</div>
		<p class="main-text"> We used SQL to communicate with the database and complete basic functions needed for the application. The queries updated, read, created, and deleted data from the database. </p>

		<p class="main-text"> We connected to the database using the JDBC driver MySQL Connector/J.</p>

		<p class="subtitles">Final Takeaways</p>
		<p class="main-text bottom-text">Through this project, I learned how to create a database and write queries that update, read, create, and delete data from the database. I also learned how to create an application using the MVC Framework, an architectural pattern I learned in my Object Oriented Design course. We used Java to create a model, which communicates with the database, and a view, which deals with user interactions. I found this to be a very helpful way to organize the code especially when multiple people are working on the same project over a long period of time.</p>
